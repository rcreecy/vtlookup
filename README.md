# Virustotal Lookup
![Interface](/readme/gui.png)

This tool provides a straightforward and ASCII happy powershell GUI to interact with Virustotal, through the API created by David B Heise and improved upon by [Dave Hull](https://github.com/davehull/VirusTotalShell)

The main purpose is to learn more about working with REST apis in powershell, as well as parsing returned data and overall understanding of building a valid and functional module.

It allows hash lookup, file lookup (with a windows popup dialog so full path entry is an option, but not a must), and URL lookup. Scanning is still a work in progress.
